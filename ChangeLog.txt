1.4.0
-----
 04Oct2020
  - Fixed minor bug introduced in cut switch behaviour. 

 26Sep2020
  - Corrected minor flaw in pre mixer where adding trim resulted in out of range values

 25Sep2020
  - Model data now saved when trim has been adjusted. This was a forgotten feature. 
  - SwA can now be used in the mixer.
  - Throttle warning can now only be passed when the throttle stick is moved to minimum.

 23Sep2020
  - Using structs now to ease model data and system data management with eeprom. The structures are 
    now copied effortlessly between ram and eeprom. This also saved us lots of flash. 
  - Added hidden boot menu. 
  - Added trims for Ail, Ele, Thr, Rud, accesible on the home screen.
  - Removed battery calibration, it was unnecessary in code and rarely used. It is a set once thing. 
  - Removed popup menu in system settings screen.
  - Stick calibration moved to hidden boot screen. 
  - Code clean up.

1.3.0
-----
 06Sep2020
  - Removed the reading and averaging several stick samples in code. This was rather unneccesary as 
    there are already capacitors for smoothing. This saved about 2ms of main loop.
 
 01Sep2020
  - Removed hardcoded timings dependent on loop counter.
 
 30Aug2020
  - Minor fixes in secondary mcu code
 
 29Aug2020
  - cleaned up receiver mcu code
 
 23Aug2020
  - Minor code improvements and cleanup
 
 18Aug2020
  - Removed unused stuff like text size and text background color from GFX lib to speed up character
    draw operations.
  - Speeded up SPI clock in LCD driver library.
 
 16Aug2020
  - Improved button events in UI. Now have pressed, clicked, held button events.
  - Fixed button handling in extended channels mode
 
 15Aug2020
  - Minor UI changes; context menu trigger moved to icon in top right of screen. Long pressing down 
    or up fast scrolls through the entries / fields.
 
 04Aug2020
  - Minor UI improvements. 
 
 02Aug2020
  - Replaced triangle waveform with stepped sine waveform
 
 28July2020
  - Slimmed down GFX library to save flash space and some ram. Unused stuff like Bresenham's line 
    algorithm, etc have been removed, and some functions have been rewritten for speed.
  - Skipped checking screen rotation (unused) in lcd driver library to speed up draw operations.
 
 18July2020
  - Backlight time now configurable
 
 12July2020
  - Slight improvements in battery warning handling, now self dismissing after 3 seconds. 
  - Slight improvements in battery gauge
 
 08July2020
  - added battery factor, battery min and battery max to advanced setup screen. Also moved stick 
    calibration to this screen
 
 26June2020 
  - Can configure pwm mode for ch3 (throttle) to either servo pulse or ordinary pwm. This is useful 
    for controlling brushed dc motors directly by the receiver without signal conversion circuits.
  - Improved master to slave serial communication. 
  - Code cleanup

1.2.0
------
 10June2020
  - Replaced all floating point maths with equivalent integer implementation
